This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with the `barCodeScanner` prop set to `true`.  Under certain conditions, particularly when the camera is initially loaded or after significant changes in lighting, the barcode scanner may fail to detect barcodes. This results in the `onBarCodeScanned` callback not being triggered, even when barcodes are clearly visible within the camera's viewfinder.
